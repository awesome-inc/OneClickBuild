The **OneClickBuild** package includes a simple `build.bat` and *MSBuild targets* bringing you closer to the famous *1-Click-Build*.

The `build.bat` shortcuts to **MSBuild** including targets for

- [versioning](#versioning) ([GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion))
- [running tests](#running-tests) ([NUnit](https://github.com/nunit), [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/)),
- [test coverage](#getting-code-coverage-opencover) ([OpenCover](https://github.com/opencover/opencover)),
- [coverage reporting](#coverage-report) ([ReportGenerator]()),
- [uploading coverage](#coverage-upload) ([coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/)) and
- [NuGet deployment](#nuget-deployment) to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

The package aims to reduce dependencies on preinstalled external tools by getting the runners directly from NuGet. The only thing you need is

1. .NET for MSBuild (preinstalled since Windows 7) and
2. `NuGet.exe` (in your path)

A new member coming to your team does not require any special tooling to compile, run tests, etc.
This makes it also perfectly suitable for continuous integration since your build jobs reduce to the same one-liner you can use in development.

**Note:** This is quite similar to how the .NET CoreCLR Team manages their build process, as posted by Stephen Cleary in [Continuous Integration and Code Coverage for Open Source .NET CoreCLR Projects](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2015/03/continuous-integration-code-coverage-open-source-net-coreclr-projects.html).

## Getting started

The **OneClickBuild** package is available as NuGet package `OneClickBuild`.
To install **OneClickBuild**, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

```powershell
PM> Install-Package OneClickBuild
```

Steps after 1st time installation:

1. Copy `OneClickBuild\tools` files to your solution root folder.

```bash
copy .\packages\OneClickBuild.[version]\tools\*.*
```

2. Rename `before.sln.targets` to `before.[solutionfilename].sln.targets`.

```bash
ren before.sln.targets before.[solutionname].sln.targets
```

3. Add files as solution items to so you're aware of the files in Visual Studio as well.

4. Complete `SolutionInfo.cs` with e.g. trademark, company & copyright info.

5. Remove duplicate assembly attributes in your `Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs`, i.e.

```csharp
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("...")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright Â©  2016")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]
```

Finally, do a test build. In your solution folder type

```bash
build
```

and you should get a clean **Release** build with version and git commit info attached
to your output assemblies (see *File -> Properties -> Details*).

Optionally you might find it helpful to wrap up on using [GitVersion](http://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/command-line/)

That's it. Enjoy!

If you have any issues or feature requests with **OneClickBuild** please raise them
with the project owners on [GitHub](https://github.com/awesome-inc/OneClickBuild).

## Additional targets

OneClickBuild brings the following additional build targets

- [**Test**](#running-tests-nunit): Runs tests. Default runner [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)
- [**Coverage**](#getting-code-coverage-opencover): Computes test/code coverage. Default: [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover)
- [**CoverageReport**](#coverage-report): Generates HTML reports from code coverage. Default: [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator)
- [**CoverageUpload**](#coverage-upload): Uploads code coverage statistics. Default: [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/)
- **Package**: Packages the project, Default: [nuget pack](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#Creating_a_Package)
- **Deploy**: Deploys the project package, Default: [nuget push](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package)

## Usage Examples

### Building your project

The Usage for `build.bat` is

```bash
build <msbuild command line>
```

where the [MSBuild Command-Line](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx) defaults to

1. build the single solution file present in the current directory
2. with target `Build`. The default `Configuration` is `Release`.

So to build your solution, open a command prompt in your solution directory and just type

```
build
```

To clean and build a specific project type

```
build Project\Project.csproj /t:Clean;Build
```

### Versioning

Version information is calculated during the build according to  [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
using [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion).

When using git workflows like [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [GitHubFlow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) then versioning is automated and you will almost never need to set a version anywhere in your project files.

However, if you really need to, you can set the semantic version of your project explicitly in `GitVersionConfig.yaml`.
See [GitVersion Usage](http://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/usage/) for more details.

#### ClickOnce versioning

With OneClickBuild 1.9.x automatic ClickOnce versioning is supported out of the box. To make this work just avoid setting the publishing version explicitly, i.e. remove the following properties from your `.csproj`

```xml
<ApplicationVersion>...</ApplicationVersion>
<ApplicationRevision>...</ApplicationRevision>
```

Note that Visual Studio will add these properties back anytime you open the [Publish Wizard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/31kztyey.aspx) or the [Publish page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff699224.aspx)

### SolutionInfo.cs: Global AssemblyInfo for all projects in your solution

Most solution wide settings for all assemblies are stored in `SolutionInfo.cs` except of the version information, which is included using [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion).

After installing `OneClickBuild` you need to strip down your original `Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs` down to the following two default attributes:

```csharp
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("MyLib")]
[assembly: Guid("22669957-af00-4154-9ec9-633664d5d29b")]
```

After this, all of your project assemblies contain the same meta information and version number.

### Running Tests

By default the target `Test` executes the **NUnit** console runner.

```xml
    <!-- ## Using NUnit (default) ## -->
    <Target Name="Test" DependsOnTargets="Build;TestWithNUnit"/>
    <Target Name="Coverage" DependsOnTargets="Build;OpenCoverWithNUnit"/>
```

For **XUnit** (since OneClickBuild 1.10) override targets `Test` & `Coverage` like

```xml
<!-- ## Using XUnit (default) ## -->
<Target Name="Test" DependsOnTargets="Build;TestWithXUnit"/>
<Target Name="Coverage" DependsOnTargets="Build;OpenCoverWithXUnit"/>
```

To run tests from the command line use

```bash
build MyLib.Tests\MyLib.Tests.csproj /t:Test
```

**Note:** When tests fail the build will fail. As the execution of tests should support build verification this is considered good build practice.

The output location for the test results can be set by the properties
`TestResultsDir` and `TestResults`. They default to

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TestResultsDir>$(SolutionDir)testresults\</TestResultsDir>
  <TestResults>$(TestResultsDir)$(ProjectName).Tests.xml</TestResults>
</PropertyGroup>
```

You can explicitly define the test assemblies to run by
including `TestAssemblies`-items in your project like this

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- run tests on "MyLib.Tests.dll" -->
  <TestAssemblies Include="MyLib.Tests.dll"/>
</ItemGroup>
```

This will run all tests found in assembly  `MyLib.Tests.dll`.
Alternatively, you can use the `TestsProjectPattern`-property to specify a
wildcard pattern like this

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- run tests on all assemblies in the output
            directory matching "*.Tests.dll" -->
  <TestsProjectPattern>$(OutDir)*.Tests.dll</TestsProjectPattern>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Typically you will go with the default which follows the convention

```xml
<TestsProjectPattern >$(OutDir)$(AssemblyName).dll</TestsProjectPattern>
```

for libraries and

```xml
<TestsProjectPattern >$(OutDir)$(AssemblyName).exe</TestsProjectPattern>
```

for applications. This presumes that you may have tests included in your production code as well as your main application code. It won't harm if you don't, however.

**Notes:**

- The `Test`-target will look up the `PlatformTarget`-property to use the correct runner, i.e.
`nunit-console.exe` for `x64/AnyCPU` or `nunit-console-x86.exe` for `x86` (likewise for **XUnit**).

- Multiple patterns can be specified with the `TestsProjectPattern`-property, e.g.

```xml
<TestsProjectPattern >$(OutDir)$(AssemblyName).exe;$(OutDir)MyCode*.dll;$(OutDir)3rdParty*.dll</TestsProjectPattern>
```

#### Explicitly using NUnit2

As of version 1.7.x OneClickBuild defaults to using the [NUnit3 console runner](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Console-Runner) which can run both NUnit3 and NUnit2 tests. If you explicitly need to specifically use NUnit2 console runner, do as follows

- Explicitly install [NUnit.Runners](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Runners/) in version 2.x
- Set `<UseNUnit2>true</UseNUnit2>`

Additionally, you can set the [NUnit XML output format](http://nunit.org/index.php?p=consoleCommandLine&r=3.0)

```xml
<NUnitResultFormat>nunit3</NUnitResultFormat>
```

In order to preserve compatibility to other tools like Jenkins & Sonar, the default is to use the legacy **NUnit2** format (`nunit2`).

When using **NUnit3** throughout all projects in your solution (recommended), a good place to set these properties is the `solution.targets`.

If you really need mixing NUnit 2 & 3 in your projects, then set these properties only in the project specific targets for the projects using **NUnit3**.

### Getting Code Coverage (OpenCover)

The target `Coverage` executes [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) targeting [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) (default) or [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/).

Run from the command line with

```bash
build MyLib.Tests\MyLib.Tests.csproj /t:Coverage
```

The output location for the coverage results can be set by the `OpenCoverOutput`-property
which defaults to

```xml
<OpenCoverOutput>$(TestResultsDir)$(ProjectName).Coverage.xml</OpenCoverOutput>
```

The default filter for **OpenCover** is

```xml
<OpenCoverFilter>+[$(AssemblyName)]* -[*]*Tests -[FluentAssertions]*</OpenCoverFilter>
```

which includes all code from the current assembly and excludes all classes ending with `Tests` and everything from the `FluentAssertions`-assembly which we use extensively in my tests. More details on **OpenCover-filters** can be found in the
[OpenCover documentation (pdf)](https://github.com/sawilde/opencover/blob/master/main/OpenCover.Documentation/Usage.pdf?raw=true)
or the [OpenCover Usage Wiki (GitHub)](https://github.com/opencover/opencover/wiki/Usage).

**Notes:**

- OneClickBuild v1.3+ supports the standard `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` attribute (see [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd984116(VS.100).aspx)). This is handy for generated code snippets or [MiniMods](https://github.com/minimod/minimods).

### Coverage Report

To generate a HTML report from the coverage xml use the `CoverageReport`-target, i.e.

```bash
build [project] /t:CoverageReport
```

This will generate a directory containing HTML defaulting to

```xml
<CoverageReportDir>$(TestResultsDir)coverage\$(ProjectName)</CoverageReportDir>
```

#### Coverage vs. Test

Running coverage usually includes running tests so you can produce results for both by just running coverage. This also reduces build time and is therefore considered as good build practice. The default behavior of the `Coverage` target is therefore to return the exit code of its target application (usually the NUnit test runner). So when a test fails the `Coverage` target will also fail.

This is the default behavior but since there may be cases where you want to get coverage even on failing code you can disable this by setting the project property `CoverageFailOnTargetFail` to `false` like this

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CoverageFailOnTargetFail>false</CoverageFailOnTargetFail>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Coverage Upload

[Status badges are cool!](http://awesome-incremented.blogspot.de/2015/05/github-boosting-your-readmemd-with.html)
To show how well your project is covered by tests you can upload your code coverage statistics using the `CoverageUpload`-target, i.e.

```bash
build [project] /t:CoverageUpload /p:CoverAllsToken=[repo_token]
```

For this you need to additional specify the `CoverAllsToken` property which you can find on your `coveralls.io` page. Note that CoverAlls.io states that it and will be free for open source projects on their [Pricing page](https://coveralls.io/pricing).

Again, you can specify the property on the command line like in the example above or anywhere in your project or solution specific targets files. We recommend the `solution.targets`.

### Project-specific targets

Overriding the default solution targets can be achieved by adding a project specific targets file. The default `solution.targets` of OneClickBuild will pick this up by doing a conditional import

```xml
<!-- ## Automatically import project-specific overrides (place this last) -->
<Import Project="$(ProjectDir)\$(ProjectName).targets" Condition="Exists('$(ProjectDir)\$(ProjectName).targets')"/>
```

#### Deploying with ClickOnce

**Note:** With [#18](https://github.com/awesome-inc/OneClickBuild/issues/18) ClickOnce is now supported out-of-the-box by the target [SetClickOnceVersion](https://github.com/awesome-inc/OneClickBuild/blob/develop/OneClickBuild/build/OneClickBuild.targets#L38).

This includes standard Windows applications as well as Microsoft Office Plugins based on [VSTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Tools_for_Office).

### Continuous Integration

#### Jenkins

In Jenkins just use the *Execute Windows Batch command* and use a command line like

```bash
build [project] [/t:targets] [/v:verbosity]
```

For automatic builds you may set MSBuild's output verbosity to minimal, e.g.

```bash
build [project] [/t:targets] /v:m
```

To publish test results use the [NUnit plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NUnit+Plugin)
and add the Post-Build step *Publish NUnit test result report* with

	testresults/*.Tests.xml

To publish coverage reports use the [HTML Publisher Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin)
and add the Post-Build step *Publish HTML reports* with

```
testresults\coverage\[project] | index.htm | Coverage [project]
```

Note that you need to generate a HTML report from the OpenCover results using

```bash
build [project] /t:CoverageReport
```

#### GitLab CI

Here is an example `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yml
stages:
  - build

job:
  stage: build
  script: build.bat /v:m
```

For more information see the [GitLab CI Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/).

### NuGet Deployment

To build a [NuGet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuGet) package from your library simply add a `Package.nuspec` file to your project and build the `Package`-target, e.g.

```bash
build MyLibrary\MyLibrary.csproj /t:Package
```

which will output `MyLibrary.[version].nupkg` to the project directory. You can override the default filename for `Package.nuspec` with the `NuspecFile`-property in `solution.targets` like

```xml
<NuspecFile>MyNuSpecFile.nuspec</NuspecFile>
```

To push the built package to a NuGet gallery use the `Deploy`-target like

```bash
build MyLibrary\MyLibrary.csproj /t:Package
```

To control the NuGet server the package is pushed to, override the property
`NuGetSourceToDeploy` in `solution.targets`. It defaults to

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <NuGetSourceToDeploy>https://www.nuget.org</NuGetSourceToDeploy>
</PropertyGroup>
```

#### <a name="ci-deploy"></a>Deploying locally vs. CI server

In general, local deployment from a developer's working directory is discouraged to avoid human errors during release. Instead, it is usually better to always let a CI server deploy a release, e.g. [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/), [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/), [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/), [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) etc.

OneClickBuild detects the presence of a CI build by checking for environment variables like `BUILD_NUMBER` (for Jenkins) and falls back to `$(Build) = 0` if no CI server is detected. In this case the default is to let the `Deploy` target fail.

Although not recommended you can override this by setting

```xml
<DeployFailOnBuildNotSet>false</DeployFailOnBuildNotSet>
```

in your `solution.targets`.

#### Example Package.nuspec
Here is a simplified version of the `Package.nuspec` that is used by `OneClickBuild` itself:

```xml

### Continuous Inspection (SonarQube)

TODO: SonarQube C# support changed to an explicit msbuild scanner, cf.:

- [Analyzing with SonarQube Scanner for MSBuild](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+MSBuild)

**Outdated:**
NUnit test results as well as OpenCover coverage reports can be directly reused in [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/).
Here is a snippet from a sample *sonar-project.properties*:

```
...
# NUnit test results (since C# 3.3)
# cf.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27460489/how-to-include-nunit-test-results-in-sonarcube-4-5-1-c-sharp-plugin-3-3-sonar-pr

...
```

## FAQ

### I get a warning from NuGet.exe saying that "restore" is an unknown command.

The command `restore` is supported since NuGet v2.7. You probably need to update your `NuGet.exe` by typing

```bash
nuget.exe update -self
```

### I use .NET 4.0 and when running coverage i get an error saying that "assembly 'System.Core, Version=2.0.5.0' could not be loaded."

OpenCover uses [AutoFac](https://code.google.com/p/autofac/) which is a great [IoC](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control) container.
However, at the time of writing *AutoFac* is deployed as [Portable Class Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/gg597391(v=vs.100).aspx) which
- for .NET 4.0 - requires the [KB2468871](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468871)-Patch  as explained
in [AutoFac Issue 415](https://code.google.com/p/autofac/issues/detail?id=415).

### I get an MSBuild error saying that OutputPath property is not set

You maybe targeting the `x86` platform and have defined `AnyCPU` as default in your project file.
When building from Visual Studio the platform property is set via the solution file. However, when building
the project you did not specify the platform property, thus defaulting to `AnyCPU` resulting in `OutputPath` not set.
To fix this issue either set the Platform property accordingly or just set the default to `x86` like this

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
  <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
  <!-- <Platform Condition=" '$(Platform)' == '' ">AnyCPU</Platform> -->
  <Platform Condition=" '$(Platform)' == '' ">x86</Platform>
```

The full error message should read something like this

```bash
"<myproject>.csproj" (Build target) (1) ->
(_CheckForInvalidConfigurationAndPlatform target) ->
  C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(609,5)
: error : The OutputPath property is not set for project '<myproject>.csproj'.
Please check to make sure that you have specified a valid combination of
Configuration and Platform for this project.  Configuration='Release'  Platform='AnyCPU'.
You may be seeing this message because you are trying to build a project without a solution file,
and have specified a non-default Configuration or Platform that doesn't exist for this project. [<myproject>.csproj]
```

### I get an MSBuild error saying that a `<project>.metaproj` could not be found

You may have set `ProjectDependencies` in your solution file which you should remove, cf.:
[Building .net 4.0 web sites: .metaproj -files (Social MSDN)](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/562ae95f-e042-45c2-9821-62cac49d0152/building-net-40-web-sites-metaproj-files?forum=msbuild)

### **Test** target fails on Windows 10 with exit code -2146232576.

NUnit runners need .NET 3.5 so you need to turn on this Windows Feature.

### **Deploy** target fails with message `error : Build number not set. See the OneClickBuild README.`

You did not specify a build number which usually indicates that you are not inside a CI build.
See section [Deploying locally vs. CI server](#ci-deploy).

### **Package** target for pre-release NuGet packages (features) fails with message `1.0.0-123-foo' is not a valid version string.`

This occurs for branch names

- beginning with a number, e.g. issue or ticket number
- configured without a GitVersion tag prefix, e.g. feature branches + GitVersion < 4.x

When using issue trackers (e.g. JIRA) it is common practice to prefix the branch name with the issue number so branch and issue can be easily synced.

For branches without a GitVersion tag prefix this causes the prelease-tag of the NuGet-version to begin with a number.

As of NuGet 2.9 this can be handled by all NuGet operations except `nuget pack`, cf. [NuGet issue #1743](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1743).

One way to resolve this is to configure prerelease-tag. For example, a good configuration for feature branches is

```yml
  tag: alpha.{BranchName}
```

Note that using the branch name is supported since [GitVersion 3.4.0](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/releases/tag/v3.4.0). In fact, using `alpha` as a prerelease tag for feature branches is so useful that it is [proposed to be the default in GitVersion 4.0](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/issues/664#issuecomment-177194815)
